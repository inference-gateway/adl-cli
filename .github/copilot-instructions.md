- Always use context7 to check for the latest updates, features, or best practices of a library relevant to the task at hand.
- Always prefer Table-Driven Testing: When writing tests.
- Always use Early Returns: Favor early returns to simplify logic and avoid deep nesting with if-else structures.
- Always prefer switch statements over if-else chains: Use switch statements for cleaner and more readable code when checking multiple conditions.
- Always run `task lint` before committing code to ensure it adheres to the project's linting rules.
- Always run `task test` before committing code to ensure all tests pass.
- Always search for the simplest solution first before considering more complex alternatives.
- Always prefer type safety over dynamic typing: Use strong typing and interfaces to ensure type safety and reduce runtime errors.
- Always use lowercase log messages for consistency and readability.
- When possible code to an interface so it's easier to mock in tests.
- When writing tests, each test case should have it's own isolated mock server mock dependencies so it's easier to understand and maintain.

## Development Workflow

1. Run `task lint` to ensure code quality.
2. Run `task test` to ensure all tests pass.
