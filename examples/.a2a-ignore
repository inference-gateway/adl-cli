# .a2a-ignore
# 
# This file specifies which files should be ignored during A2A CLI generation operations.
# Patterns work similar to .gitignore:
# - Use # for comments
# - Use / at the end to match directories
# - Use * for wildcards
# - Exact file paths or glob patterns

# Skip Docker-related files if you have custom containerization
Dockerfile
docker-compose.yml

# Skip Kubernetes manifests if you use different deployment tools
k8s/

# Skip specific generated files you want to customize
middleware.go
auth.go

# Skip build configuration if you have custom setup
Taskfile.yml

# Skip IDE-specific configurations
.vscode/
.idea/

# Skip generated README if you have custom documentation
README.md

# Skip .gitignore if you have project-specific patterns
.gitignore

# Examples of pattern matching:
# *.yaml          - All YAML files
# test_*          - All files starting with test_
# **/config.go    - All config.go files in any directory
# tools/          - Entire tools directory
